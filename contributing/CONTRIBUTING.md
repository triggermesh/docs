# Contributing to TriggerMesh

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/triggermesh/docs/issues) already for the change you want to make.

Before you submit a PR, please first view our [Style Guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md). Here you will find rules and examples for our capitalizations, punctuation, and more.

### GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track issues. You can create an issue (bug report or feature request) by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/triggermesh/docs/issues/new); it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What browser you found the bug
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

#### Write feature request with detail, background, and sample code

Great Feature Requests tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Alternative solutions
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Be as through as possible. There is no such thing as too much information!

### Making Changes

###### Fork using GitHub Desktop

Getting started with [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the [repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

###### Fork using the command line

[Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Pull Requests(PR)

When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review. The best PR's are thorough. Be sure to tell us what changes you made and why. If possible include a video or provide images.

##### Submit your PR

Once you submit your PR, others from the TriggerMesh community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a self review. We may have questions, so be sure to check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.

##### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- Confirm that the changes address every part of the plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them).
- Review the content for technical accuracy.
- Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to our [style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md).

##### Reviewing

We review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use TriggerMesh.

- Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.
- Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.
- Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

##### Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
