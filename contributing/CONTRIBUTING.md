# Contributing to TriggerMesh

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

#### GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track issues. You can create an issue (bug report or feature request) by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/triggermesh/docs/issues/new); it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What browser you found the bug
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

#### Write feature request with detail, background, and sample code

Great Feature Requests tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Alternative solutions
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Be as through as possible. There is no such thing as too much information!
