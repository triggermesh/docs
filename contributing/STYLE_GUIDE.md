## Unordered Lists (Bullet Lists)

For Unordered Lists (a.k.a. Bullet Lists) we would like to use of `-` instead of `*`.

`-` would be the more logical choice, since it eliminates the ambiguity between `*` (bullet point), `* *` (italic) and `**` `**` (bold).

## Ordered Lists (Number Lists)

For Ordered Lists (a.k.a. Number Lists) we would like to use `1. 1. 1.` instead of `1. 2. 3.` for listing numbers.

`1. 1. 1.` is actually the recommended way to create numbered lists in Markdown. The generated page will have the correct numbering, not `1. 1. 1.`....

The advantage is that you can add/remove elements to a list without having to renumber everything manually.
