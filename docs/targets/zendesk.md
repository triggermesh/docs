# Event Target for Zendesk

This event target receives [CloudEvents][ce] and uses the Zendesk API to either create a new ticket or tag an existing one.

## Prerequisites

A Zendesk API token is required to utilize this Target. The steps to obtain a token are outlined in the [Zendesk API Docs](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/226022787-Generating-a-new-API-token-)

## Deploying an Instance of the Target

Open the Bridge creation screen and add a Target of type `Zendesk`.

In the Target creation form, provide a name to the event Target, and add the following information:

* **Default Ticket Subject**: An optional ticket subject fallback if one is not provided in an incoming event.
* **Zendesk Subdomain**: Name of the Zendesk [Subdomain][zd-subdom], without the `zendesk.com` domain or `https://` scheme.
* **Zendesk Email**: Email address associated with the Zendesk account.
* **Zendesk API Token**: Reference to a [TriggerMesh secret][tm-secret] containing a [token][zd-token] to communicate with the Zendesk API, as described in the previous section.

After clicking the `Save` button, the console will self-navigate to the Bridge editor. Proceed by adding the remaining components to the Bridge.

After submitting the bridge, and allowing some configuration time, a green check mark on the main _Bridges_ page indicates that the bridge with a Zendesk event Target was successfully created.
