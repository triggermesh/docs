# Event Target for Hasura

This event Target receives [CloudEvents][ce] as either a [GraphQL][graphql] query or key/value
pairs for a known query and sends it to [Hasura][hasura].

## Prerequisite(s)

- Hasura server URL to submit the query against

- Admin secret or JWT

## Admin Secret or JWT

If the Hasura server requires authentication, an [admin secret][hasura-admin] or [JWT][hasura-jwt] signed with the server's key will be required.

If using JWT, you may choose to add an optional user role to invoke the queries as.

Consult the [Secrets](../guides/secrets.md) guide for more information about
how to add the admin or user JWT as secrets.

## Deploying an Instance of the Target

Open the Bridge creation screen and add a Target of type `Hasura`.

![Adding a Hasura Target](../../assets/images/hasura-target/create-bridge-1.png)

In the Target creation form, provide a name for the event Target and add the following information:

- **Admin Token for Hasura**: Reference to a [TriggerMesh secret](../guides/secrets.md) containing an [admin secret][hasura-admin] or [JWT][hasura-jwt] to communicate with Hasura as discussed in [Admin Secret or JWT](#admin-secret-or-jwt).
- **Hasura Server URL**: URL endpoint to communicate with Hasura.
- **Default Role**: Specify the Hasura user role to use when querying Hasura.
- **Pre-canned Queries**: A key/value pair of predefined queries available for [CloudEvents][ce] to specify.

After clicking the `Save` button, the console will self-navigate to the Bridge editor. Proceed by adding the remaining components to the Bridge.

After submitting the Bridge, and allowing for some configuration time, a green check mark on the main _Bridges_ page indicates that the Bridge with a Hasura event Target was successfully created.

## Event Types

A Hasura event Target accepts the following [CloudEvent][ce] types:

### org.graphql.query.raw

Events of this type are raw [GraphQL][graphql] queries intended to be submitted directly to Hasura.

This type expects a [JSON][ce-jsonformat] payload with the following properties:

| Name  |  Type |  Comment |
| ---|---|---|
| **query**| string| The GraphQL to run against the Hasura server|
| **operationName**| string| The query name specified in the **query** attribute|
| **variables**| map[string]string| Key/value pairs of variables with the key defined in the query|

The response event will have the `ce-type` attribute set to `org.graphql.query.result` and
`ce-source` attribute set to the Target's endpoint.

### org.graphql.query

Events of this type leverage the pre-defined query defined when the Target is created. In addition
to the `ce-type`, the `ce-subject` must be set to the name of the pre-defined query, otherwise
the event will not be processed by the Target.

The [JSON][ce-jsonformat] payload for this type must consist of a string dictionary where the
keys correspond to the variables defined in the query, and key's value is passed as a string.

The response event will have the `ce-type` attribute set to `org.graphql.query.result` and
`ce-source` attribute set to the Target's endpoint.
