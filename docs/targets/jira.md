# Event Target for Jira

This event Target receives [CloudEvents][ce] and invokes a Jira endpoint.

## Prerequisite(s)

- Jira instance or Atlassian cloud tenant
- User API token

## User API token

1. Open **Account settings > Security >** [Create and Manage API Tokens][api-tokens]
1. Click `Create API token` and fill out the token name.
1. Copy the API token and create a secret for the Jira token at TriggerMesh.

Consult the [Secrets](../guides/secrets.md) guide for more information about how to add a secret.

## Deploying an Instance of the Target

Open the Bridge creation screen and add a Target of type `Jira`.

In the Target creation form, provide a name for the event Target, and add the following information:

- **User**: the Jira user account that created the token.
- **URL**: base URL for the Jira instance.

After clicking the `Save` button, the console will self-navigate to the Bridge editor. Proceed by adding the remaining components to the Bridge.

After submitting the Bridge, and allowing for some configuration time, a green check mark on the main _Bridges_ page indicates that the Bridge with a Jira event Target was successfully created.
