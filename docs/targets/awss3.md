# Amazon S3 target

Sends events to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

With `tmctl`:

```
tmctl create target awss3 --arn <arn> --auth.credentials.accessKeyID <access key> --auth.credentials.secretAccessKey <secret key>
```

On Kubernetes:

Secret

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aws
type: Opaque
stringData:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "<AWS Access Key ID>"
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "<AWS Secret Access Key>"
```

Target

```yaml
apiVersion: targets.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: AWSS3Target
metadata:
  name: triggermesh-aws-s3-test
spec:
  arn: arn:aws:s3:::bucket
  auth:
    credentials:
      accessKeyID:
        valueFromSecret:
          name: aws
          key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      secretAccessKey:
        valueFromSecret:
          name: aws
          key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

When TriggerMesh is running on Amazon EKS, you can use an IAM role for authentication rather than an access key and secret. In this case, TriggerMesh will generate a Kubernetes service account for you that will leverage this IAM role. You also have the option of specifying your own service account name, and if a service account with the same name already exists and it is already managed by the TriggerMesh controller, then it will be reused. By reusing the same serivce account in this way, you can avoid having to create many STS trust relationships for each generated service account.

```yaml
auth:
  iam:
    roleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/dev-role
    serviceAccount: aws-source-sa
```

For more details on authenticating with AWS, please take a look at our [dedicated guide on AWS credentials](../guides/credentials/awscredentials.md).

There is an optional toggle flag indicating if the full CloudEvent should be sent
to S3 bucket. By default, this is disabled which means only the event payload
will be sent.

Accepts events of any type, with a special rule for `io.triggermesh.awss3.object.put` for which the target
will store the payload body regardless of the `Discard CloudEvent context attributes` setting.

The Amazon S3 bucket key used to store the event is defined by the `ce-subject` attribute.
If `ce-subject` is not set, the default key will be: **ce-type**/**ce-source**/**ce-time**.

Attributes for the `put`operation are:

* type `io.triggermesh.awss3.object.put`
* subject: `string`, the key to use with the assigned bucket for the Target
* `data` contains the payload to store

Responds with events with the following attributes:

* type `io.triggermesh.targets.aws.s3.result`
* source `arn:aws:s3:...`, the S3's bucket ARN value as configured by the target
* `data` contains a JSON response from the Target invocation with the Etag associated with the request

See the [Kubernetes object reference](../../reference/targets/#targets.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1.AWSS3Target) for more details.

## Prerequisite(s)

- AWS API key and secret
- ARN for the S3 bucket to store the event

The ARN for the S3 bucket must include the account number and region of a
pre-defined [access point][aws-s3-ap].
