# Event Target for Twilio

This event Target receives [CloudEvents][ce] and utilizes [Twilio][landing] to enable the creation and delivery of SMS
messages via event data and event occurrence, respectively.

## Prerequisite(s)

- [Twilio][try] account with access to the [Account SID][sid] & [API Access Token][token]
- [Phone number][pn]

Consult the [Secrets](../guides/secrets.md) guide for more information about
how to add the Twilio Account SID and API Access Token as secrets.

## Deploying an Instance of the Target

Open the Bridge creation screen and add a Target of type `Twilio`.

In the Target creation form, give a name to the event Target and add the following information:

- **Default source phone number (_Optional_)**: Sender's phone number, usually configured to the [phone number][pn] purchased at
  Twilio.
- **Default destination (_Optional_)**: Phone number to send messages to by default.
- **SID Secret**: Reference to a [TriggerMesh secret](../guides/secrets.md) containing the [SID of the Twilio account][sid].
- **Token Secret**: Reference to a [TriggerMesh secret](../guides/secrets.md) containing an [API Access token][token] for
  authenticating requests against the Twilio API.

Both the **Default source phone number** and **Default destination** configurations may be overridden by any
[CloudEvent][ce] message received by the Target.

For more information about using Twilio, please refer to the [Twilio documentation][docs].

After submitting the Bridge, and allowing for some configuration time, a green check mark on the main _Bridges_ page
indicates that the Bridge was successfully created.

## Event Types

A Twilio event Target accepts the following [CloudEvent][ce] types:

### io.triggermesh.twilio.sms.send 

Events of this type intend to send a SMS message via Twilio.

This type expects a [JSON][ce-jsonformat] payload with the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **message** | string | Text to be sent in the body of the SMS message. |
| **media_urls** | string | Array of URLs pointing to JPEG, GIF or PNG resources. |
| **from** | string | Phone number sourcing the communication. Takes precedence over the value from the Twilio Target spec. |
| **to** | string | Phone number of the destination. Takes precedence over the value from the Twilio Target spec. |
