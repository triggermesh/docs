# Amazon EventBridge target

Sends events to an [Amazon EventBridge partner event
bus][intro].

With `tmctl`:

```
tmctl create target awseventbridge --arn <arn> --awsApiKey <awsApiKey> --awsApiSecret <awsApiSecret>
```

On Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: targets.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: AWSEventBridgeTarget
metadata:
  name: triggermesh-aws-eventbridge
spec:
  arn: arn:aws:events:us-west-2:<PROJECT_ID>:event-bus/cab-knative-event-test
  awsApiKey:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: aws
      key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  awsApiSecret:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: aws
      key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

The Amazon EventBridge event Target can consume events of any type.

Responds with events with the following attributes:

* type `io.triggermesh.targets.aws.eventbridge.result`

See the [Kubernetes object reference](../../reference/targets/#targets.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1.AWSEventBridgeTarget) for more details.

## Prerequisites

Although this event source can immediately start receiving events, those events **can only be consumed after associating
the TriggerMesh partner event source with a corresponding [partner event bus][event-bus]**.

To associate the TriggerMesh partner event source with a partner event bus:

1. Navigate to the _Partner event sources_ menu of the Amazon EventBridge Console.
1. Select the "Pending" partner event source which name starts with `aws.partner/triggermesh.com`.
1. Click the `Associate with event bus` button.

On the next screen called _Associate with event bus_, click the `Associate` button.

Back to the _Partner event sources_ page, your partner event source should now show as "Active".

You will also see a custom event bus named after the TriggerMesh partner event source on the _Event buses_ page.

Your can now start creating rules that trigger on certain events in the Amazon EventBridge console.
