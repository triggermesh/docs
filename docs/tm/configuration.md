## Configuration

**On TriggerMesh:**

1. If you do not yet have access, Login to the TriggerMesh cloud at [https://cloud.triggermesh.com](https://cloud.triggermesh.com)
2. Download your TriggerMesh configuration file by clicking on the `download` button in the upper right corner

3. Save the file as `$HOME/.tm/config.json` and you are ready to use the `tm` CLI

**On Your Own Knative Cluster:**

Assuming you have access to the Kubernetes API and have a working `kubectl` setup, `tm` should work out of the box.
