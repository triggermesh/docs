# Observability

The TriggerMesh platform provides operational and usage insight into its various components via two types of
instrumentations:

- [Structured logging](./observability-logging.md)
- [Telemetry metrics](./observability-metrics.md)

This observability data can be consumed and visualized using industry standard monitoring solutions.
