# Event Target for Amazon EventBridge

This event Target receives arbitrary [CloudEvents][ce] over HTTP and sends them to an [Amazon EventBridge partner event
bus][intro] in a [JSON format][ce-jsonformat].

## Deploying an Instance of the Target

Open the Bridge creation screen and add a target of type `Amazon EventBridge`.

In the Target creation form, provide a name for the event Target and add the following information:

- [AWS account ID][aws-acc-id]: defines the AWS account in which the TriggerMesh partner event source is to be created.
- [AWS region][aws-regions]: defines the AWS region in which the TriggerMesh partner event source is to be created.

After clicking the `Save` button, you will be taken back to the Bridge editor. Proceed to adding the remaining
components to the Bridge, then submit it.

A ready status on the main _Bridges_ page indicates that the TriggerMesh partner event source was successfully created.

Although this event source can immediately start receiving events, those events **can only be consumed after associating
the TriggerMesh partner event source with a corresponding [partner event bus][event-bus]**.

To associate the TriggerMesh partner event source with a partner event bus:

1. Navigate to the _Partner event sources_ menu of the Amazon EventBridge Console.
1. Select the "Pending" partner event source which name starts with `aws.partner/triggermesh.com`.
1. Click the `Associate with event bus` button.

On the next screen called _Associate with event bus_, click the `Associate` button.

Back to the _Partner event sources_ page, your partner event source should now show as "Active".

You will also see a custom event bus named after the TriggerMesh partner event source on the _Event buses_ page.

Your can now start creating rules that trigger on certain events in the Amazon EventBridge console.
