# Event Source for AWS CodeCommit

This event source captures notifications from an [AWS CodeCommit repository][cc-docs] whenever a specific action, such
as a new commit or the creation of a pull request, happens in this repository.

## Prerequisite(s)

* CodeCommit Repository and Branch
* Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
* API Credentials

### CodeCommit Repository and Branch

If you don't already have an AWS CodeCommit repository, create one by following the instructions at [Create an AWS
CodeCommit repository][cc-create]. The repository should contain at least one [branch][cc-branches]. To create one,
follow the instructions at [Create a branch in AWS CodeCommit][cc-branch-create].

### Amazon Resource Name (ARN)

A fully qualified ARN is required to uniquely identify the AWS CodeCommit repository.

The easiest way to obtain the ARN of a CodeCommit repository is by using the [AWS CLI][aws-cli]. The following command
retrieves the information of a repository called `triggermeshtest` in the `us-west-2` region:

```console
$ aws codecommit get-repository --repository-name triggermeshtest --region us-west-2
{
    "repositoryMetadata": {
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "repositoryId": "510acd3d-b96d-473c-bbe4-a8c6799d02a9",
        "repositoryName": "triggermeshtest",
        "defaultBranch": "main",
        "lastModifiedDate": "2020-07-20T20:54:27.806000+02:00",
        "creationDate": "2020-07-20T20:49:12.324000+02:00",
        "cloneUrlHttp": "https://git-codecommit.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/triggermeshtest",
        "cloneUrlSsh": "ssh://git-codecommit.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/triggermeshtest",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:codecommit:eu-central-1:123456789012:triggermeshtest"
    }
}
```

If you don't have the AWS CLI installed on your workstation, you can use the template below to compose a fully
qualified ARN of a CodeCommit repository.

```
arn:aws:codecommit:{awsRegion}:{awsAccountId}:{repositoryName}
```

### API Credentials

The TriggerMesh event source for Amazon CodeCommit authenticates calls to the AWS API using AWS Access Keys. The page
[Understanding and getting your AWS credentials][accesskey] contains instructions to create access keys when signed-in
either as the root user or as an IAM user. Take note of the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, they will be
used to create an instance of the event source.

It is considered a [good practice][iam-bestpractices] to create dedicated users with restricted privileges in order to
programmatically access AWS services. Permissions can be added or revoked granularly for a given IAM user by attaching
[IAM Policies][iam-policies] to it.

As an example, the following policy contains only the permissions required by the TriggerMesh AWS CodeCommit event
source to operate:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "codecommit:GetBranch",
                "codecommit:GetCommit",
                "codecommit:ListPullRequests",
                "codecommit:GetPullRequest"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:*:*:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deploying an Instance of the Source

Open the Bridge creation screen and add a source of type `AWS CodeCommit`.

![Adding an AWS CodeCommit source](../images/awscodecommit-source/create-bridge-1.png)

In the Source creation form, give a name to the event source and add the following information:

* [**AWS ARN**][arn]: ARN of the CodeCommit repository, as described in the previous sections.
* [**Branch name**][cc-branches]: Name of the Git branch the source should be watching for commits.
* **Event types**: List of event types the event source should subscribe to.
* [**AWS Secret**][accesskey]: Reference to a [TriggerMesh secret][tm-secret] containing an Access Key ID and a Secret
  Access Key to communicate with the AWS CodeCommit API, as described in the previous sections.

After clicking the `Save` button, you will be taken back to the Bridge editor. Proceed to adding the remaining
components to the Bridge, then submit it.

A ready status on the main _Bridges_ page indicates that the event source is ready to receive notifications from the AWS
CodeCommit repository.
