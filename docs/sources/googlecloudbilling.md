# Event Source for Google Cloud Billing

This event source receives messages from a [Google Cloud Billing][gc-billing] Budget
over a [Google Cloud Pub/Sub][gc-billing-events] topic.

## CLI

Coming soon.


### Service Account

A Service Account is required to authenticate the event source and allow it to interact with Google
Cloud Billing budget.

The service account must be granted an IAM Role with at least the following permissions:

- `billing.budgets.get`
- `billing.budgets.update`

The following set of permissions is also required to allow this source to manage the Pub/Sub topic and subscription:

- `pubsub.subscriptions.create`
- `pubsub.subscriptions.delete`

The predefined `roles/billing.costsManager` and `roles/pubsub.editor` roles are an example of roles that are suitable for use with the TriggerMesh event
source for Google Cloud Billing.

Create a key for this service account and save it. This key must be in JSON format. It is required to be
able to run an instance of the Google Cloud Billing event source.

### Deploying an Instance of the Source

#### Prerequisite(s)

- Billing Account ID: The identifier for the Cloud Billing account owning the budget. For example, 01D4EE-079462-DFD6EC.
- Budget ID: The identifier for the Cloud Billing budget. You can locate the budget's ID in your budget under "Manage notifications".
             The ID is displayed after you select Connect a Pub/Sub topic to this budget. For example, de72f49d-779b-4945-a127-4d6ce8def0bb.

## Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: GoogleCloudBillingSource
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  billingAccountId: myBillingAccountId
  budgetId: mybudgetId

  pubsub:
    project: my-project
    # Alternatively, provide a pre-existing Pub/Sub topic:
    # topic: projects/my-project/topics/my-topic

  serviceAccountKey:
    value: >-
      {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "my-project",
        "private_key_id": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "triggermesh-billing-source@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",

### Event Types

The TriggerMesh event source for Google Cloud Billing emits events of the following type:

- `com.google.cloud.billing.message`

### Known Issues

Because the Google Cloud Billing API doesn't allow disabling a Budget's notifications programmatically,
budget notifications will remain enabled even after the deletion of the event source. The destination
Pub/Sub topic will nevertheless be deleted, effectively causing the interruption of budget notifications.
