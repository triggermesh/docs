# Event Source for Amazon DynamoDB

This event source captures changes to items stored in an [Amazon DynamoDB Table][ddb-docs] by reading the time-ordered
sequence of item-level modifications from a [DynamoDB Stream][ddb-streams].

## Prerequisite(s)

- DynamoDB Table and Stream
- Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
- API Credentials

### DynamoDB Table and Stream

If you don't already have an Amazon DynamoDB Table, create one by following the instructions at [Getting Started with
DynamoDB][ddb-gettingstarted]. In order for change notifications to be consumed by the TriggerMesh Amazon DynamoDB event
source, it is mandatory to enable a [Stream][ddb-streams] on the DynamoDB Table. To do so, follow the instructions at
[Enabling a Stream][ddb-stream-enable]. You are free to select the _View type_ that is the most suitable for your own
usage of the event source.

### Amazon Resource Name (ARN)

A fully qualified ARN is required to uniquely identify the Amazon DynamoDB Table.

This ARN can be obtained directly from the _Overview_ tab after clicking the DynamoDB Table name in the list of existing
tables. It typically has the following format:

```
arn:aws:dynamodb:{awsRegion}:{awsAccountId}:table/{tableName}
```

Alternatively, one can obtain the ARN of a DynamoDB Table by using the [AWS CLI][aws-cli]. The following command
retrieves the information of a table called `triggermeshtest` in the `us-west-2` region:

```console
$ aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name triggermeshtest --region us-west-2
{
    "Table": {
        "TableName": "triggermeshtest",
        "TableStatus": "ACTIVE",
        "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/triggermeshtest",
        (...)
    }
}
```

### API Credentials

The TriggerMesh event source for Amazon DynamoDB authenticates calls to the AWS API using AWS Access Keys. The page
[Understanding and getting your AWS credentials][accesskey] contains instructions to create access keys when signed-in
either as the root user or as an IAM user. Take note of the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, they will be
used to create an instance of the event source.

It is considered a [good practice][iam-bestpractices] to create dedicated users with restricted privileges in order to
programmatically access AWS services. Permissions can be added or revoked granularly for a given IAM user by attaching
[IAM Policies][iam-policies] to it.

As an example, the following policy contains only the permissions required by the TriggerMesh Amazon DynamoDB event
source to operate:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:ListStreams",
                "dynamodb:DescribeStream",
                "dynamodb:GetShardIterator",
                "dynamodb:GetRecords"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deploying an Instance of the Source

- [**AWS ARN**][arn]: ARN of the DynamoDB Table, as described in the previous sections.
- [**AWS Secret**][accesskey]: Reference to a [TriggerMesh secret][tm-secret] containing an Access Key ID and a Secret
  Access Key to communicate with the Amazon DynamoDB API, as described in the previous sections.

## Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: AWSDynamoDBSource

  name: sample
spec:
  arn: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/triggermeshtest

      accessKeyID:
        valueFromSecret:

          key: aws_access_key_id
      secretAccessKey:
        valueFromSecret:
          name: awscreds
          key: aws_secret_access_key

  sink:
