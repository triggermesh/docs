This is the documentation of TriggerMesh's Integration Language and its tooling.

The _TriggerMesh Integration Language_ is a configuration language based on the [HCL syntax](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/main/hclsyntax/spec.md) which purpose is to provide a user-friendly interface for describing [TriggerMesh Bridges](https://www.triggermesh.com/integrations).

Using the `til` CLI tool, it is possible to turn Bridge descriptions into deployment manifests which can run complete messaging systems on the TriggerMesh platform.

!!! info "Get Started with `til`"
    To learn how to install `til` and get started quickly with your first bridge go the TIL [getting started guide](../guides/tilgettingstarted.md).

## Deployment

The `til` CLI tool does not impose any particular deployment method on the user. Instead, it outputs deployment manifests in a format that is generic enough to be deployable by a variety of third-party tools. Pages in this section describe the format of the data generated by `til`, and provide concrete examples of using popular Kubernetes deployment tools to materialize a Bridge onto the TriggerMesh platform.
