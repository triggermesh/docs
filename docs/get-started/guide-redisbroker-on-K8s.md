# Getting Started with the Redis Broker on Kubernetes

In this introduction tutorial we are going to setup a RedisBroker with a Trigger that sends events to a Target endpoint, and if the delivery faisl to a Dead Letter Sink endpoint.

## Instructions

TriggerMesh Core includes 2 components:

* RedisBroker, which uses a backing Redis instance to store events and routes them via Triggers.
* Trigger, which subscribes to events and push them to your targets.

Events must conform to [CloudEvents spec](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) using the [HTTP binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md).

Create a RedisBroker named `demo`.

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triggermesh/triggermesh-core/main/docs/assets/manifests/getting-started-redis/broker.yaml
```

Wait until the RedisBroker is ready. It will inform in its status of the URL where events can be ingested.

```console
kubectl get redisbroker demo

NAME   URL                                                        AGE   READY   REASON
demo   http://demo-rb-broker.default.svc.cluster.local   10s   True
```

To be able to use the broker we will create a Pod that allow us to send events inside the Kubernetes cluster.

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triggermesh/triggermesh-core/main/docs/assets/manifests/common/curl.yaml
```

It is possible now to send events to the broker address by issuing curl commands. The response for ingested events must be an `HTTP 200` which means that the broker has received it and will try to deliver them to configured triggers.

```console
kubectl exec -ti curl -- curl -v http://demo-rb-broker.default.svc.cluster.local/ \
    -X POST \
    -H "Ce-Id: 1234-abcd" \
    -H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
    -H "Ce-Type: demo.type1" \
    -H "Ce-Source: curl" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"test1":"no trigger configured yet"}'
```

Unfortunately we haven't configured any trigger yet, which means any ingested event will not be delivered. `event_display` is a CloudEvents consumer that logs to console the list of events received. We will be creating 2 instances of `event_display`, one as the target for consumed events and another one for the Dead Letter Sink.
A Dead Letter Sink, abbreviated DLS is a destination that consumes events that a subscription was not able to deliver to the intended target.

```console
# Target service
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triggermesh/triggermesh-core/main/docs/assets/manifests/common/display-target.yaml

# DLS service
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triggermesh/triggermesh-core/main/docs/assets/manifests/common/display-deadlettersink.yaml
```

The Trigger object configures the broker to consume events and send them to a target. The Trigger object can include filters that select which events should be forwarded to the target, and delivery options to configure retries and fallback targets when the event cannot be delivered.

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triggermesh/triggermesh-core/main/docs/assets/manifests/getting-started-redis/trigger.yaml
```

The Trigger created above filters by CloudEvents containing `type: demo.type1` attribute and delivers them to `display-target` service, if delivery fails it will issue 3 retries and then forward the CloudEvent to the `display-deadlettersink` service.

Using the `curl` Pod again we can send this CloudEvent to the broker.

```console
kubectl exec -ti curl -- curl -v http://demo-rb-broker.default.svc.cluster.local/ \
    -X POST \
    -H "Ce-Id: 1234-abcd" \
    -H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
    -H "Ce-Type: demo.type1" \
    -H "Ce-Source: curl" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"test 2":"message for display target"}'
```

The target display Pod will show the delivered event.

```console
kubectl logs -l app=display-target --tail 100

☁️  cloudevents.Event
Validation: valid
Context Attributes,
  specversion: 1.0
  type: demo.type1
  source: curl
  id: 1234-abcd
  datacontenttype: application/json
Extensions,
  triggermeshbackendid: 1666613846441-0
Data,
  {
    "test": "value2"
  }
```

To simulate a target failure we will reconfigure the target display service to make it point to a non existing Pod set:

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triggermesh/triggermesh-core/main/docs/assets/manifests/common/display-target.yaml
```

Any event that pass the filter will try to be sent to the target, and upon failing will be delivered to the DLS.

```console
kubectl exec -ti curl -- curl -v http://demo-rb-broker.default.svc.cluster.local/ \
    -X POST \
    -H "Ce-Id: 1234-abcd" \
    -H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
    -H "Ce-Type: demo.type1" \
    -H "Ce-Source: curl" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"test 3":"not delivered, will be sent to DLS"}'
```

```console
kubectl logs -l app=display-deadlettersink --tail 100

☁️  cloudevents.Event
Validation: valid
Context Attributes,
  specversion: 1.0
  type: demo.type1
  source: curl
  id: 1234-abcd
  datacontenttype: application/json
Extensions,
  triggermeshbackendid: 1666613846441-0
Data,
  {
    "test": "value3"
  }
```

## Clean Up

To clean up the getting started guide, delete each of the created assets:

```console
# Removal of display-target not in this list, since it was deleted previously.
kubectl delete -f \
