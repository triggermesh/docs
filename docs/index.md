## For CLI lovers

If you would prefer to use a CLI, we have prepared `tm` for you.

`tm` is a generic Knative client with some added features to deploy functions from source. You can download `tm` by following our [instructions](https://docs.triggermesh.io/tm/install)

For example you will be able to bypass the console and do something like this:

```
tm deploy service hello --from-image=gcr.io/cloudrun/hello
```
