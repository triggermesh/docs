# Creating a Wiretap
In this guide we will create a Wiretap to monitor the Cloudevent traffic happening within our bridge.


## What is a Wiretap?
A Wiretap is a powerful debugging tool/methodology that can be used to understand the flow of events through the system by subscribing to all of the events that pass through the associated `Broker`. This is accomplished by the use of a `Trigger` to route all of the events into a logging service.


Consider the following illustration:

## Implementing a Wiretap
### Creating an Example Bridge
Lets consider [this example Bridge](../assets/yamlexamples/simple-bridge.yaml) as a starting point. This example is currently configured with a `PingSource` and a `Broker`.

```yaml
apiVersion: flow.triggermesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: Bridge
metadata:
  name: cron-sockeye
  annotations:
    bridges.triggermesh.io/name: cron-sockeye
    bridges.triggermesh.io/description: >-
      This is a simple starter bridge containg only a PingSource and a broker.
spec:
  components:
    - object:
        apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Broker
        metadata:
          name: events
      options:
        enableResync: false
    - object:
      apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
      kind: PingSource
      metadata:
        name: ping-sockeye
      spec:
        data: '{"name": "triggermesh"}'
        schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
        sink:
          ref:
            apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
            kind: Broker
            name: events
            options:
              enableResync: false
```

### Implement a Wiretap
Now that we have a bridge to work with, lets go ahead and modify our manifest to include a Wiretap. We can do this by adding a `Trigger` and a `Service` to our manifest. The `Service` we will be using will be using is called [Sockeye](https://github.com/n3wscott/sockeye), this is a simple web application that will log the events it receives.

We can accomplish this by adding the following to the manifest under the `PingSource` object:

```yaml
    - object:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Trigger
      metadata:
        name: sockeye
      spec:
        broker: events
        subscriber:
          ref:
            apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
            kind: Service
            name: sockeye
    - object:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: sockeye
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: docker.io/n3wscott/sockeye:v0.7.0@sha256:e603d8494eeacce966e57f8f508e4c4f6bebc71d095e3f5a0a1abaf42c5f0e48
```

### Using the Wiretap
Now that we have all the parts in place, we can utilize our `Wiretap` to monitor the events that are being sent through our bridge by the `PingSource` Object. We can do this in two ways.

1. View the pod logs of the `sockeye` service:
  * `kubectl get pods` will show the pods that are running. Retrieve the sockeye pod name from the output.
  * `kubectl logs <SOCKEYE_POD_NAME> user-container` By replacing the `<SOCKEYE_POD_NAME>` with the pod name you can view the logs of the sockeye pod.

2. View the web service exposed by the `sockeye` service:
  * `kubectl get ksvc` will show the KSVC's that are running. Retrieve the sockeye public URL from the `URL` column and navigate to it in your browser.
